title: AI Writing
---

A pillar for producing clear, consistent writing with AI — from briefs to publish-ready drafts.

## Scope
This pillar covers: briefs, outlines, drafts, rewrites, tone alignment, and structured documents.
It does not cover: deep domain research without sources, or legal/medical advice.

## Principles
- **Contract first**: define format, audience, constraints, and “done”.
- **Structure beats style**: outline before drafting.
- **Assumptions are labeled**: don’t hide missing info.
- **One section = one purpose**: avoid mixed intent.
- **Consistency matters**: terminology, tense, voice, formatting.
- **Edit in passes**: content → structure → language → polish.

## Standard workflows
### 1) Brief → Outline → Draft
1. Brief: goal, audience, constraints, key points, examples.
2. Outline: headings + bullet intent per section.
3. Draft: fill sections, keep scope.
4. QA: run the checklist, fix gaps.

### 2) Rewrite / Improve clarity
1. Keep meaning (no semantic drift).
2. Simplify structure (shorter sentences, cleaner paragraphs).
3. Normalize terminology and tone.
4. Final QA.

## Prompt patterns
### A) Contract prompt (base)
- Goal:
- Audience:
- Format:
- Constraints:
- Inputs (paste):
- Output requirements (must include):

### B) Outline-first prompt
“Create an outline first. Wait for approval. Then write the draft using the approved outline.”

### C) QA prompt
“Check this output using the Quality Checklist. Report issues in bullets, then provide a corrected version.”
