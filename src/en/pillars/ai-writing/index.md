# AI for writing (reliable output)

Use this when you need **clean text** (emails, docs, landing pages) without hallucinations and fluff.

## The 4‑step method
1) **Define the deliverable** (format, length, audience, tone).  
2) **Provide inputs** (facts, constraints, examples).  
3) **Force structure** (headings, bullets, tables).  
4) **Run a quality pass** (checks below).

## Copy‑paste “writer contract”
```text
You are my writing assistant.
Task: <what to produce>.
Audience: <who will read>.
Tone: <neutral / friendly / strict>.
Constraints: <must include / must not include>.
Sources: If you’re unsure, say “UNKNOWN” instead of guessing.
Output format: <markdown / email / checklist / table>.
```

## Quality checks
- Are there any invented facts or numbers? If yes → remove or mark as UNKNOWN.
- Is the structure readable (headings, bullets)?
- Does it match the requested tone and length?
