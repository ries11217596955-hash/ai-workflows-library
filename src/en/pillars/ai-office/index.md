# AI for office work

Core rule: **AI drafts, you verify**.

## Universal office prompt
```text
Role: operations assistant.
Goal: produce <deliverable>.
Inputs (facts): <bullet list>.
Constraints: keep it concise, no invented data.
Output: structured markdown with headings.
Add a “Checks” section at the end: what should I verify?
```

## What works best
- Turning messy notes into **a plan** (steps, owners, deadlines)
- Creating **tables** (comparison, schedule, checklist)
- Drafting **emails** with clear subject + CTA
