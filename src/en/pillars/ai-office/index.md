A pillar for office-grade AI outputs: documents, tables, slides, and email — with a release mindset.

## Scope
Covers: Word-like docs, spreadsheets, slide decks, meeting notes, action plans, and operational templates.
Does not cover: client confidential processing without controls, or “automation that runs itself” without review.

## Typical outputs
- Meeting notes → action plan
- Checklists and SOP drafts
- Tables: trackers, logs, registries
- Slides: one-pagers, status, pitch outlines
- Emails: follow-ups, summaries, requests

## Artefact standards (minimum)
- **Clear title + purpose** in the first screen.
- **Stable structure** (headings, consistent list style).
- **Naming**: predictable paths and slugs (no spaces if your repo convention forbids them).
- **Version/Status**: MVP / v0.x when applicable.
- **No sensitive data** in public assets.

## Risk & compliance
- Remove personal data and confidential details before publishing.
- If a template includes placeholders, keep them clearly generic.
- Avoid “invented facts” — cite or label assumptions.
