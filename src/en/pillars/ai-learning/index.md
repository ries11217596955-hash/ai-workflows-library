# AI for learning

Goal: **understand**, not just “get an answer”.

## Safe study prompt
```text
Act as a tutor.
Explain <topic> in simple terms.
Then ask me 5 questions to test understanding.
If you are unsure about a fact, say UNKNOWN.
```

## Best outputs
- Summary + key terms
- Practice questions with answers
- Study plan for 7–14 days
