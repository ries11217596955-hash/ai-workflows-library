title: Prompt Contract
---
A compact "request contract" to make AI outputs consistent and reviewable.
## When to use
Use this when you want repeatable outputs (docs, emails, plans, scripts), especially for "publish / send / ship".
## Contract template (copy/paste)
Fill only what matters. Mark unknowns as **[ASSUMPTION]**.
- **Goal:** (what success looks like)
- **Audience:** (who will read/use it)
- **Context:** (why / where it will be used)
- **Inputs:** (data, notes, links, constraints)
- **Output format:** (headings, table columns, file naming, length, tone)
- **Must include:** (sections, fields, mandatory items)
- **Must avoid:** (forbidden claims, sensitive data, speculation)
- **Acceptance checks:** (what makes it "PASS")
- **Sources:** (provided / none / required)
- **Assumptions:** (explicit)
- **Next step:** (what you will do with the output)
## Recommended prompt
> Use this as your first message for any workflow.
**PROMPT**
1) Use this contract. If something is missing, label it **[ASSUMPTION]**.  
2) Output strictly in the requested format.  
3) End with a short checklist: what is verified vs assumed.
