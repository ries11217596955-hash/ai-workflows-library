# Quality checklist (anti‑hallucination)

Use this before you copy any AI output into “real life”.

## 10 checks
1) **Facts:** any numbers, dates, names — are they real?  
2) **Assumptions:** are assumptions explicit?  
3) **Scope:** does it answer the question you asked (not another one)?  
4) **Missing pieces:** what info was required but absent?  
5) **Contradictions:** do parts conflict with each other?  
6) **Actionability:** can someone execute it step by step?  
7) **Tone:** matches the audience (neutral/friendly/strict)?  
8) **Risk:** any legal/medical/financial claims → remove or cite sources.  
9) **Safety:** no harmful instructions.  
10) **Next step:** one clear next action.
