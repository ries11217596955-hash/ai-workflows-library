# One text → 10 social posts

Goal: turn one long piece into a **consistent 10-post pack** (same ideas, different angles).

## Inputs (copy & fill)
- Source text (paste):
- Target platform (X/LinkedIn/Instagram/Telegram):
- Audience (who exactly):
- Tone (calm/strong/friendly/professional):
- CTA (what you want people to do):
- Constraints (no claims, no prices, no medical/legal advice, etc.):

## Prompt (paste into AI)
**Role:** You are a social content editor.  
**Task:** Create 10 posts based strictly on the source text. Do not add new facts. If a claim is not supported by the source, remove it or mark as “needs verification”.

**Output format (repeat 10 times):**
- Post #:
- Hook (1 line)
- Body (3–7 lines)
- CTA (1 line)
- Optional hashtags (0–5)
- “Why this post works” (1 line)

**Variation rules:**
- Posts must differ: tip, story, checklist, myth vs fact, mistake, mini-framework, example, Q&A, summary, contrarian take.
- Keep language simple. Avoid hype.

**Inputs:**

## Quality check (quick)
- No new facts beyond the source.
- Each post is readable in <20 seconds.
- CTA matches the goal (subscribe/save/comment/download).
- Tone consistent across all 10.
