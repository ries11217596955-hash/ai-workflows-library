# Tailor a resume to a job

**Goal:** Produce a targeted resume + bullet achievements aligned to a job description.

## What you need (inputs)
- Your current resume (text)
- Job description (text)
- 2–3 measurable achievements (optional)

## Copy‑paste prompt templates
**Prompt 1 — Resume rewrite**

```text
Rewrite my resume for this job. Preserve facts. Do not invent companies or dates.
Output:
1) Summary (3 lines)
2) Skills (bullets)
3) Experience bullets (STAR format)
4) Keywords list used
Input resume:
<<<RESUME>>>
Job description:
<<<JD>>>
```

**Prompt 2 — Achievement bullets**

```text
From my experience section, rewrite bullets to be measurable and impact-focused. Keep facts.
Output: 8–12 bullets.
Experience:
<<<TEXT>>>
```

**Prompt 3 — ATS check**

```text
Compare this resume against the job description.
Output:
- Missing keywords
- Weak sections
- 5 concrete improvements (no fluff)
Resume:
<<<RESUME>>>
JD:
<<<JD>>>
```
